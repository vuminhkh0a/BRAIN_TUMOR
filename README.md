# üß† Brain Tumor Detection App (WIP)

An experimental Streamlit application for detecting brain tumors from medical images.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This project is **still under development** and not yet intended for clinical use.

## Demo App

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://vuminhkhoa-brain-health.streamlit.app/)

## GitHub Codespaces

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/vuminhkh0a/BRAIN_TUMOR?quickstart=1)

## Features

- Upload MRI brain scan images  
- Early-stage implementation of tumor classification/detection  
- Built with **Streamlit** for quick prototyping and deployment  
- Code written in **Python** with focus on deep learning methods (PyTorch planned)  

## Project Status

This app is currently **incomplete**:  
- ‚úÖ Initial UI built with Streamlit  
- üöß Model integration and full detection pipeline in progress  
- üîú Future improvements will include better preprocessing, model training, and evaluation  

## Local Setup

To run the app locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vuminhkh0a/BRAIN_TUMOR.git
cd BRAIN_TUMOR
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
